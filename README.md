# AirBnB Clone Project

This project is a backend clone of the AirBnB platform. It's designed to help us understand how full-stack applications work, from database design to API development.

#  üìå Project Goals

- Build a robust backend for an AirBnB-like platform.
- Practice user authentication, property listings, booking flow, and payment integration.
- Learn to work in a team using Git, GitHub, and Agile methodologies.

# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask (or Django depending on final decision)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Draw.io, Postman
# Roles and Responsibilities - AirBnB Clone Project

- 
## üß∞ Technology Stack
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend logic and RESTful APIs quickly and securely.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database used to store and manage user, property, booking, and payment data.
- **GraphQL**: A query language and runtime that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving efficiency over traditional REST endpoints.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the application, ensuring consistent environments for development, testing, and deployment.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and team collaboration. Git tracks changes in code, and GitHub hosts the project repository.
- **Draw.io**: A diagramming tool used to design system architecture, use case diagrams, and ER models.
- **Postman**: A tool for testing and debugging API endpoints during development.
- **Python**: The core programming language used to write server logic and handle data processing.
